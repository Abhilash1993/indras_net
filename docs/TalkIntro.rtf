Agent-based modeling is a computer programming technique for simulating complex interactions among numerous individuals, each of which is following a small set of rules in their behavior. It has been widely used in economics, political science, sociology, anthropology, biology, and computerized animation. It was even used to create the battle scenes in The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, as well as in films such as Avatar and I, Robot. Dr. Callahan has been developing an agent-based modeling system using the computer programming language Python.}
