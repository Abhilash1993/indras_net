The Meaning of Prehensions

__________________________________

The Indra system is organized around the idea of "prehensions." The term comes
from the work of Alfred North Whitehead. It may not be the best term for what
we are doing, but it occurred to us as suitable, and so we ran with it.

A prehension is reality as seen from a certain vantage point. In our system,
each agent has two initial prehensions:

1) The agent's prehension of its own state, including its goal.
2) The agent's pretension of its environment.

An agent combines these two prehensions and the result is a third presehension.
That pretension can be interpreted as an action, in other words, the agent's
response to its own situation and the environment in which it finds itself.

Thus, we see Indra system is essentially built upon the Aristotelian idea of the
practical syllogism.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_syllogism)

In our system, the major premise of Aristotle's practical syllogism is 
the agent's understanding of its own condition, e.g., for a fashion follower
in our fashion model:

Major Premise: I want the fashion I wear be the same as the fashion of the
trendiest people.

The minor premise is the agent's view of its environment:

Minor Premise: The trendy people I see around me are wearing blue.

The conclusion of an Aristotelian practical syllogism is not a proposition,
but an action. Thus, given the major and minor premises above, the "conclusion"
of the practical syllogism is:

Conclusion: Let me change my garb to blue.
