    "## A First Model Using Indra2 ##\n",

    "The aim of re-writing the library code upon which Indra models relied was to reduce the complexity of the system, and achieve greater expressiveness with fewer lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the results look promising. Let's take a look at the beginnings of the first model being written based on the `indra2` library. This is a classic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotkaâ€“Volterra_equations\">predator-prey model</a>, often called \"wolf-sheep\" in the ABM world. The central idea is to model how populations of predators and their prey will cycle in a circumscribed environment.\n",
