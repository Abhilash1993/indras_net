Indra
=====
This is a project building an agent-based modeling system in Python. The
ultimate goal is to build a GUI front-end that will allow non-coders to build
models, while at the same time permitting coders to use Python for more
flexibility in model creation.


We are currently building **indra2**, a new version of the system. Our API
Serever is moving along,  we have a react frontend in progress, and many models
have been ported to version 2.

Create Development Environment
------------------------------
To configure your system for development, first install Python 3 and git and
then run `make create_dev_env`. This will install some dependencies using PIP.
Follow the outputted instructions for setting your environment variables.

To build the Docker container with the development environment, run
`make dev_container`.

To run the Docker container with the development environment, run
`./dev_cont.sh`.
