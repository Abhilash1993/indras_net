This is a project building an agent-based modeling system in Python. The ultimate goal is to build a GUI front-end that will allow non-coders to build models, while at the same time permitting coders to use Python for more flexibility in model creation.

basic_run.py creates a barebones environment of agents that just print their names. It can be the basis for your own run file.

fashion.py is Adam Smith's fashion model.

height.py is Thomas Schelling's genetic engineered height model.

predator_prey.py is the core of a family of predator prey models, of which Smith's fashion model is the first.
