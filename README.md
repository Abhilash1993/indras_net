Indra
=====
This is a project building an agent-based modeling system in Python. The ultimate goal is to build a GUI front-end that will allow non-coders to build models, while at the same time permitting coders to use Python for more flexibility in model creation.


We are currently building **indra2**, a new version of the system. Updates of the readme to come.
