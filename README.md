This is a project building an agent-based modeling system in Python. The ultimate goal is to build a GUI front-end that will allow non-coders to build models, while at the same time permitting coders to use Python for more flexibility in model creation.

IMPORTANT NOTE: We have established a standard for models and parameter files that run them. For model X, we should have

X_model.py: implements the model

X_run.py: runs it

basic_model.py is an simple agent and environment. Cloning this allows you to get going more easily.

basic_run.py creates a barebones environment of agents that just print their names. It can be the basis for your own run file.

entity.py contains the basic agent class, and basic environment, as well as some plumbing for connecting them.

fashion_model.py is Adam Smith's fashion model.

fashion_run.py sets some parameters for fashion_model.py, and then runs the model.

height.py is Thomas Schelling's genetic engineered height model. height_run.py runs the model.

predator_prey.py is the core of a family of predator prey models, of which Smith's fashion model is the first. pred_run.py runs this model.

prop_args.py is the start of a property manager.

spatial_agent.py contains an agent sub-class and environment sub-class that position agents in space.
