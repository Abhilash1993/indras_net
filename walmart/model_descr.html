            Background
        </h2>
            <p>
                Conventional wisdom from “free market” economists would have it that
                moves to ban “big box” retailers such as Walmart from certain localities
                are rebellions against consumer sovereignty and must hurt consumer
                welfare. After all, if consumers did not want to shop at the big box
                retailer, they would simply not do so, correct? The fact that they
                switch their shopping to the big box and away from “mom-and-pop” stores
                show they prefer the big box.
            </p>
            <p>
                This paper attempts to show that such analysis is simplistic. We present
                a model in which all consumers have the following preference ordering in
                some retail sector:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> Have both local shops and the big box store.
                <li> Have only local shops.
                <li> Have only the big box store.
            </ol>
            <p>
                We then show that, under not outrageous assumptions, it is easy for
                consumers, in trying to achieve their first preference, to instead wind
                up with their third. This is due to consumers facing a prisoner’s
                dilemma, as well as knowledge problems: Consumers might, if they had
                perfect knowledge of the exit points of the local shops and the ability
                to finely coordinate their own shopping, be able to achieve their first
                preference (a mix of big box and mom-and-pop shopping available). But,
                in general consumers have little knowledge of how much sales must be
                reduced before a small shop will exit the industry, nor do they have
                very much ability to coordinate their shopping with other consumers.
                Therefore, since they cannot fine tune their shopping to achieve 1),
                they shop at the big box store whenever it suits them for a particular
                purchase, without regards to the “macro” effects of their choices. The
                end result is that all of the mom-and-pops are driven out of business,
                despite no consumer wanting that result. Thus, it may make sense, faced
                with such knowledge and game theoretic difficulties, for consumers to
                bind themselves in advance to 2), by banning a, or some, or all, big box
                stores.
