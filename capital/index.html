            Modeling the Capital Structure
        </h1>

        <p>
            This project is intended to capture the idea of capital structure,
            as presented in the works of Ludwig von Mises, Ludwig Lachmann,
            Israel Kirzner, and others.
        </p>

        <p>
            The project is being worked on by Manxueying Li.

        <h2>What is Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT)?</h2>
        <p>
    	    Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT) developed by Austrian school
            of economics views business cycle as a result of artificially low interest rate leading to the imbalance between saving and investment. Low interest rate stimulates business investment because of the lower cost of borrowing money. More investment bid up prices for capital goods increasing the cost of production along with the false information about sufficient recourse cause the uncompleted production of final products which are not capable of turning into profit. As a result, companies are not able to sell their product and a lot of resources are being wasted leading to an economic downturn.
        </p>

        <h2>Why agent-based modeling?</h2>
        <p>
            The agents are "computational objects modeled as interacting according to rules". The rules are designed to model behavior and social interactions based on incentives and information.
            The foundimental thing in ABCT is individual choice when facing certain forms of central bank activity and "agent" in the model can represent individual, social groups in the economic system. The phenomenon observed in the economy can be represented by the interaction of multiple agent.

        <h2>What I learned from "Does austrian business cycle theory help explain the dot-com boom and bust?"</h2>
        <p>
            The boom and bust happened during 1995 and 2000 is observed in the enormous increase and rapid decline in stock price and Internet-related assets. The increase in new money led to increase in liquidity, and, as a result, bid up the price of capital goods making some of the business plan not feasible (exceed production posibility frontier). As the interest rate kept low, the consumer in the artificial boom will make malinvestment and over-consumption leading to a further increase in housing market and debt to equity ratio.

        <h2>
            What I learned from "Capital and its structure"
        </h2>
        <p>
            how firm invest in capital goods and creating capital structure.
            <ul>
                <li>equilibrium: all value consistent with each other â€”> money as measurement of capital change</li>
                <li>Capital structure consists of heterogeneous capitals, and each of them only be used for limited purpose</li>
                <li>Capitals are scarce resources with alternative use, therefore, they should be capable of truning into goods and services and fit into each other(complementary goods)</li>
                <li>what determine the capital structure? production plan (mkt force) ->revising at the end of successful period -> predictable</li>
                <li></li>
