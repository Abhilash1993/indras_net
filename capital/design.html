            Modeling the Capital Structure: Design
        </h1>

        <p>
            this page is for some writeup for the design of the model
        </p>
        <h2><b>Capital Model:</b></h2>
        <p>Two entity type:</p>
        <p>Resource owners: ( who have resources and want to sell them )</p>
        <ul>
            <li>List of various amount of capitals occupied</li>
            <li>Fixed price for each capital</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Entrepreneurs: ( who are interested in buying resources needed )</p>
        <ul>
            <li>List of Initial capitals</li>
            <li>List of capitals they already have</li>
            <li>List of various amount capitals they want</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All capitals are measured in dollars</p>
        <p>The program interact with the user for initial conditions of resource holders
            and entrepreneur ( how much capitals each entrepreneur wants
            or how much resources each resource holder has. )</p>
        <p>For each round, entrepreneur will search on their neighborhood.
            When encountering a resource owner nearby,
            they will ask for the capital they want.
            If the owner has what they want, buy in with the price offered by the owner.
            Continue searching until they get all the capital needed.</p>

        <h2><b>Edgeworthbox Model:</b></h2>
        <p>The curve in edgeworthbox is a pareto optimal meaning the reallocation of resources
            cannot make one group better off without making others worse off, in other word, it
            represents the most efficient allocation of resources.</p>
        <p>Each group only willing to trade when the marginal utility which is the change in
            utility by making the transaction is positive, meaning he/she can be better off by
            conducting the trade. The points on each person's indifference curve, representing different quantities of
            two goods between which a consumer is indifferent, represent equally liked
            combinations of quantities of the two goods for that person.</p>
