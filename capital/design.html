        <p>Update for October 2:</p>
        <p>Two entity type:</p>
        <p>Resource owners:(who have resources and waht to sell them)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Capitals occupied</li>
            <li>Rixed price for each capital</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Entrepreneurs:(who are interested in buying resources needed)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Initial capital</li>
            <li>Capitals they already have</li>
            <li>Capitals they want</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For each round, entrepreneur will search on their neighborhood.
            When encountering a resource owner nearby, they will ask for the capital they want.
            If the owner has what they want, buy in with the price offered by the owner.
            Continue searching until they get all the capital needed.</p>
