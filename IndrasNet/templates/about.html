<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>Indra is an agent-based modeling (ABM) system in Python. </p>
<br>
<p>The ultimate goal is to simplify ABM creation
    so that a model can be specified in only a few
    lines of code, or by filling in a few parameters on
    a screen. To that end we plan to build a Web
    front-end that will allow non-coders to build models,
    while at the same time permitting coders to use Python
    for more flexibility in model creation.</p>
