            <p>
                In addition to possible technical advantages this project
                possesses as a result of including members who have an advanced
                understanding of site design and reliability engineering,
                there are also potential advantage from an advanced
                model of matching producers with consumers.
                In particular, we have already done work, in an
                agent-based-modeling context, on using a <i>vector-space</i>
                model to match agents with other agents. We feel this holds
                great promise for producer-consumer matching, as it would allow
                matching along many dimensions, each given a weighting
                dependant upon the importance the consumer gives to that 
                dimension.
