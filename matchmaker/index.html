                Overview
            </summary>

            <p>
                This project aims to create a generic framework
                to match consumers of a product with its
                producers, &agrave; la Uber or AirBnB. The
                reason such a framework might be desirable is 
                that it could free producers from the
                hegemony of the network provider, by allowing
                then to easily bring up their own 
                matching service.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is a hypothesis of the project that 
                this family of services have
                <a href="common.html">
                    enough in common</a>
                that a generic framework can
                cover a large enough portion of what
                goes on that creating a specific service
                can be done (mostly?) by non-programmers using
                templates. So, we are looking at providing
                "Platform-as-a-Service" (PaaS), with an open-source 
                core.

            <p>
                Taking our cue from previously successful projects of this
                type, such as GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, Jira, etc., our
                model will be to keep the whole core of the system open source,
                and basic use of it free.
                This will assure potential users that they are not "locking in"
                to a new proprietary platform by choosing to commit to our
                PaaS. Instead, revenue will be derived from:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Providing a fee-based hosting environment that will make putting up
                    a "matchmaker" service extremely easy; and
                </li>

                <li>
                    Selling consulting and other specialized services as
                    add-ons to the freely avialable code base.

                    providing potential users with a PaaS. Instead, they are,
                    for instance, "developing a platform with the help of the
