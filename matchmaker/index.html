            <p>
                This project aims to create a generic framework
                to match consumers of a product with its
                producers, &agrave; la Uber or AirBnB. The
                reason such a framework might be desirable is 
                that it could free producers from the
                hegemony of the network provider, by allowing
                then to easily bring up their own 
                matching service.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is a hypothesis of the project that 
                this family of services have
                <a href="common.html">
                    enough in common</a>
                that a generic framework can
                cover a large enough portion of what
                goes on that creating a specific service
                can be done (mostly?) by non-programmers using
                templates.
