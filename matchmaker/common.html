            Common features of producer neetworks
        </h1>

        <ul>
            <li>
                A number of producers
            </li>

            <li>
                A (probably much larger) number of consumers
            </li>

            <li>
                The consumers do not know which particular producer
                they want to use, e.g., "Just get me some Thai food!"
                "I need an apartment in Milan," "A carpenter could build that."
            </li>

            <li>
                Consumers needs are qualified, e.g., "Within 20 minutes,"
                "With two or more bedrooms," "Who charges under $100
                per hour."
            </li>

            <li>
                There are typical sorts of qualifications, e.g., time, money,
                and distance being the most common.
            </li>

            <li>
                Both sides to the transaction want to know about the reputation
                of the other side, e.g., "Will it be tasty?"
                "Is the tenant going to trash the joint?" and
                "Will it fall down?"
            </li>

            <li>
                Transactions should be secured, verified, held in escrow, etc.
                as needed.
            </li>

        </ul>
