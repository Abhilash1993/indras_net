                Project Goal
            </h2>

                <p>
		Indra is an agent-based modeling (ABM) system in Python.
                </p>

		<p>
		The ultimate goal is to build a GUI front-end that will allow non-coders
            	to build models, while at the same time permitting coders to use Python for
             	more flexibility in model creation.
		</p>

            <h2>
                Project Architecture
            </h2>

		<h3>
		   Agents and Environments
		</h3>
			<p>
			Indra&rsquo;s structure can be appreciated philosophically. We start by
			considering the following question, What are the most general features of
			all population dynamics?
			</p>

			<p>
			In order to have a population we have to have members of that population, and
			since these members must *do* something we call them
			"<a href=https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/entity.py>agents.</a>"
			So these agents act, and action always has a definite character, designed to reach an end.
			For this reason, all agents are also assigned a goal.
			For example, sheep are agents that run away from wolves because their goal is to not be
			eaten. These agents all exist within some world defining the ways they may interact
			with other agents. For example, wolves are agents limited by distance. They
			have to reach the sheep before they can eat them! This world in which interaction
			takes place we call the 
			"<a href=https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/env.py>environment</a>,"
			env for short.
			</p>
	
			<p>
			All agents act, and while respose to the external env is not stricty required, whenever
			an agent needs to know something about it's external world, it has to peer into its
			env to see what&rsquo;s about. For this reason, agents access information about other
			agents strictly through the env object that it lives in.
			</p>

		<h3>
		   The User, the Menu, and the Environment
		</h3>

			<p>
			The 
			<a href=https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/user.py>user</a> 
			is of course given control to run the program and to display its data.
			His primary method of interface is through the
			<a href=https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/menu.py >menu</a>.
			</p>

		<h3>
		    Agent Pop and the Program
		</h3>

			<p>
			   Agent pop is where we record all the information about the agents in an
		           active model.
			</p>

		<h3>
		    Universals and Everything
		</h3>
		
			<p>
			One last generality can be noted. Agents have some kind of relation to one another
			and to the env they act within. Even the user has a relation to these things. He
			called them into existence and manages everything!
			To express these connections, nearly everything in the program
			is a 
			<a href=https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/node.py>node</a>
			in an all-encompassing graph.
			Thus everything is interconnected through 
			<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net>Indra's Net.</a>
			And thus we may record abstract relationships of the kind similar to that which is in our
			mind.
			</p>

			<p>
			Universals are a type of node that relate classes and their instances. They aren&rsquo;t
			currently used right now.
			</p>

                Current Models
            </h2>

		<h3>
		    Forest Fire
		</h3>

			<p>
			Simulates fires starting and spreading through a forest. Burned out trees
			are replaced by new growth, which after aging are suseptible to catching
			and spreading fire.
			</p>

		<h3>
		    Wolf-Sheep
		</h3>

			<p>
			Simulates wolves chasing sheep and sheep avoiding wolves in a meadow. The animals
			may reproduce. Once a wolf is near a sheep, it eats him.
			</p>

		<h3>
		    Fashion Model
		</h3>

			<p>
			In the metropolitan fashion scene, there are the trend-setters and the trend-followers.
			These we call hipsters and followers. Hipsters do not want to look like followers, and
			followers do not want to look like hipsters.

		<h3>
		    Auditorium Model
