    Indra Agent-Based Modeling System
  </h1>
  <h2>
    Project Goal
  </h2>

  <p>
    Indra is an agent-based modeling (ABM) system in Python.
    <br>
    <br>
    The ultimate goal is to simplify ABM creation so that a
    model can be specified in only a few lines of code, or by
    filling in a few parameters on a screen.
    To that end we are building
    <a href="webapp.html">
      a Web front-end
    </a>
    that will
    allow non-coders to build models, while at the same time
    permitting coders to use Python for more flexibility in
    model creation.
    It will use our <a href="http://indrasnet.pythonanywhere.com">API Server</a>
    to run the models.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Current Models
  </h2>

  <h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/indras_net/blob/master/models/forestfire.py">
      Forest Fire
    </a>
  </h4>

  <p>
    Simulates fires starting and spreading through a forest. Burned out trees
    are replaced by new growth, which after aging are suseptible to catching
    and spreading fire.
  </p>

  <h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/indras_net/blob/master/models/wolfsheep.py">
      Wolf-Sheep
    </a>
  </h4>

  <p>
    Simulates wolves chasing sheep and sheep avoiding wolves in a meadow. The
    animals may reproduce. Once a wolf is near a sheep, it eats him.
  </p>

  <h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/indras_net/blob/master/models/fashion.py">
      Fashion Model
    </a>
  </h4>

  <p>
    In the metropolitan fashion scene, there are the trend-setters
    and the trend-followers.
    These we call hipsters and followers. Hipsters do <i>not</i> want to look
    like followers, but
    followers <i>do</i> want to look like hipsters.

    <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/indras_net/blob/master/schelling/segregation.py">
      Segregation Model
    </a>
  </h4>
  <p>
    Schelling's famous model of neighborhood segrgegation, even if no one
    has a preference for such neighborhoods.
  </p>

  <h4>
    <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/indras_net/blob/master/models/fmarket.py">

  <p>
    A financial market with value investors and trend followers.

  <h2>
    Project Architecture
  </h2>

  <h3>
    Agents and Environments
  </h3>
  <p>
    Indra&rsquo;s structure can be appreciated philosophically. We
    start by considering the following question, What are the most
    general features of all population dynamics?
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to have a population we have to have members of that population,
    and since these members must *do* something we call them "<a
    href=https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/entity.py>agents.
    </a>" So these agents act, and action always has a definite character,
    designed to reach an end. For this reason, all agents are also assigned a
    goal. For example, sheep are agents that run away from wolves because their
    goal is to not be eaten. These agents all exist within some world defining
    the ways they may interact with other agents. For example, wolves are
    agents limited by distance. They have to reach the sheep before they can
    eat them! This world in which interaction takes place we call the "<a
                                                                           href=https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/env.py>environment</a>,"
                                                                       env for
                                                                       short.
  </p> <p> All agents act, and while respose to the external env is not strictly
  required, whenever an agent needs to know something about it's external
  world, it has to peer into its env to see what&rsquo;s about. For this
  reason, agents access information about other agents strictly through the env
  object that it lives
      in.
  </p>

  <h3>
    The User, the Menu, and the Environment
  </h3>

  <p>
    The
    <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/user.py">
      user
    </a>
    is of course given control to run the program and to display its data.
    But the key idea here is that the "user" appears as another node in
    Indra's net, meaning the agents can conceivably "see" the user and
    interact with him/her.
    His primary method of interface is through the
    <a href="https://github.com/gcallah/Indra/blob/master/indra/menu.py">
      menu
    </a>, but more complicated interactions are possible.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Graphics Capabilities
  </h3>
  <p>
    We currently have fairly extensive graphics capabilities built in
    to the system through
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib">
      matplotlib.
    </a>
    These include plotting changes in agent populations, tracing agent
    movement (live) on a scatter plot, and examining the
    object-hierarchy at play in a program at any point in time.
