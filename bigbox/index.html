            Introduction
        </h2>
            <p>
                Conventional wisdom from committed "free market"
                economists would have it that moves to ban
                "big box" retailers such as Walmart from certain localities
                are rebellions against consumer sovereignty and must hurt consumer
                welfare. After all, if consumers did not want to shop at the big box
                retailer, they would simply not do so, correct? The fact that they
                switch their shopping to the big box and away from "mom-and-pop" stores
                shows they prefer the big box.
            </p>

        <h2>
            Theoretical Considerations
        </h2>
            <p>
                This paper attempts to show that the above analysis is simplistic.
                We present a model in which all consumers have the following 
                preference ordering in some retail sector:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Have both local shops and a big box store.
                <li>Have only local shops.
                <li>Have only a big box store.
            </ol>
            <p>
                We then show that, under not outrageous assumptions, it is easy for
                consumers, in trying to achieve their first preference, to instead wind
                up with their third. This is due to consumers facing a collective action
                problem, as well as a knowledge problem: Consumers might, if they had
                perfect knowledge of the exit points of the local shops and the ability
                to finely coordinate their own shopping with that of others,
                be able to achieve their first preference
                (a mix of big box and mom-and-pop shopping available). But,
                in general consumers have little knowledge of how much sales must be
                reduced before a small shop will exit the industry, nor do they have
                very much ability to coordinate their shopping with other consumers.
                (Meaning that even if they forego a certain amount of shopping
                at the big box stores, which they would otherwise do, simply to
                keep the small stores solvent, they cannot ensure their
                neighbors will do the same. So their rational choice is to
                "defect" and shop at the big box store as often as they wish,
                regardless of the impact on the small shops.)
                <br>
                <br>
                Therefore, since they cannot fine tune their shopping to achieve 1),
                they shop at the big box store whenever it suits them for a particular
                purchase, without regards to the “macro” effects of their
                choices. They shift "too" much of their shopping to the big
                box, with the end result is that all of 
                the mom-and-pops are driven out of business,
                despite no consumer wanting that result. Thus, it may make sense, faced
                with such knowledge and game theoretic difficulties, for consumers to
                bind themselves in advance to 2), by banning a, or some, or all, big box
                stores, or to trying to achieve 1) by, say, forcing big box
                retailers to locate well outside the center of town, making
                trips to them less convenient.
                <br>
                <br>
                We further suggest that our model they actually capture the
                mechanism underlying the intuition of the existence of
                "predatory pricing." As has often been noted, the idea that
                big box stores engage in predatory pricing to drive out small
                competitors and then jack up the prices to achieve high profits
                has an obvious problem: once the prices charge by the big box
                stores have been raised, why don't the small competitors simply
                reenter the market? (See, for instance, DiLorenzo, 1992.)
                <br>
                <br>
                Our model avoids this pitfall: the big box stores do not need
                to set prices below cost: they can rely
                on their greater financial resources to ride out the period
                during which <b>all</b> stores will be losing money, and once their
                smaller competitors have exited, they can keep their prices right
                where they were, and now be profitable. And new smaller
                competitors will not enter the market, since that would merely
                reestablish the situation in which all stores are losing money.

        <h2>
            Model Design 
        </h2>
            <p>
                We create a model populated by three types of agents:
                consumers (C), mom-and-pops (M), and big-boxes (B).
                The mom-and-pops are further divided by each supplying a
                specific type of good, such as hardware or groceries, while the
                big-boxes provide every sort of good.
                At first "space" is occupied by only M and C. Each supply
                something the other needs to continue in existence: the
                consumers supply money to the mom-and-pop stores, who supply
                goods to the consumers. Ms receive a periodic endowment of
                goods "from heaven" (which is a parameter),
                while Cs have the same thing happen in
                regards to money. Cs shop in turn at each stores selling each
                type of good they need. If Ms run out of money, they disappear.
            </p>

            <p>
                At some point in the progress of the model, the Bs appear. They
                have a much larger initial endowment of money then do the Ms.
                The Cs like both (how much they like each is again a parameter),
                and split their acquisition of goods (according to that
                parameter) between the two types of agents. This split causes the money
                supply of both types of agents to dwindle. But as the Bs have
                much more money to start, they are able to survive this period
                of coexistence, while the Ms gradually disappear. We are left with
                an environment of only Bs and Cs, which the Cs did <em>not</em>
                want. Thus, under very simple but not outrageous conditions,
                our model shows our story above as plausible: it has what Weber
                would call "explanatory adequacy." Empirical work
                would be necessary to decide whether it has Weberian "causal
                adequacy." (See Callahan and Horwitz, 2010.)

            <h3>
                The Indra System
            </h3>
                <p>
                    Indra is an agent based modeling (ABM) system built in Python. Our model
                    runs on it, and this means that understanding our model requires
                    some understanding how it concieves ABMs to work. And so it would be valuable
                    to review its <a href="https://gcallah.github.io/Indra/index.html">architecture</a>.
                </p>

            <h3>
                Implementing the Big Box Model in Indra
            </h3>
                <h4>
                    Overview
                </h4>
                    <p>
                        In our model, the environment is EverytownUSA which is populated by agents called,
                        MarketParticipants who may sell goods. Our model includes two kinds of MarketParticipant:
                        Consumers and Retailers. Consumers buy goods, and Retailers sell them. Additional
                        pressure is exerted on the Retailers: they must pay rent and, upon threat of forclosure,
                        must not go bankrupt.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        In addition to running on the base framework of agents and environments, our
                        model includes Indra's Markov classes. These allow our Consumers to display
                        psuedorandom shopping behavior according to the logic of
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chains</a>. These 
                        Consumers choose to either buy from a MomAndPop Retailer or a BigBox retailer;
                        their preference is decided by use of a
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_matrix">transition matrix</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The way we read the transition matrix is as follows. Our Consumer sees that there 
                        are both MomAndPop and BigBox retailers who sell his desired good. Further, he has
                        a predilection for the MomAndPops such that he goes to them about 70% of the time;
                        leaving the remaining 30% of shopping for the BigBox stores. In our program, this 
                        would give our particular Consumer the transition matrix,
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After this a random number generator uses this information to calculate which store 
                        he will travel to.
