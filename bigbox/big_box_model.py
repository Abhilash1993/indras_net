big_box_model.py
Simulates a small town with consumers.

The consumers may shop at either "Mom and Pop" and chain "Big Box" stores. The
town's consumers prefer the local stores, but will shot at the 
big box retailer when convenient. The major difference between Mom and 
Pops and Big Boxes is the larger endowment Big Boxes have initially.

Initially there are only local stores, but later the big box stores come in and 
change the population dynamic.
