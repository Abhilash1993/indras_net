"""
big_box_model.py

Simulates a small town with consumers.

The consumers may shop at either "Mom and Pop" and chain "Big Box" stores.
The town's consumers prefer the local stores, but will shot at the big box
retailer when convenient. The major difference between Mom and Pops and Big
Boxes is the larger endowment Big Boxes have initially. Initially there are
only local stores, but later the big box stores come in and change the
population dynamic.
