Consumer Utility
------------------

We model the consumerâ€™s preference in the following way. Above all he
prefers the mom and pop stores. Thus, his utility is his innate
preference plus some random factor (to account for variations in his
mood or in the quality of the product etc.) Thus,

U = (pref_mp + randIntBetweenZeroAndOne) 

Yet he also gains something from having the big box store present too.
This does not have an innate preference. Therefore he only gains
something of the random variation of the market:

U = (pref_mp + randIntBetweenZeroAndOne) + randIntBetweenZeroAndOne

The overall utility in the market is expressed as the sum of these
factors. To rephrase our thesis: consumers have the most utilty when
both mom-and-pops and big-boxes are around, they have the second
greatest utility when they have only mom-and-pops, and the least
utilty when they have only big-boxes. It turn out that even in cases
of high preference  for mom-and-pop stores, in the end the consumers
least desired outcome results.

Big Box Statistics
------------------

Runs

We ran seventy-five runs of seventy five periods each. The following
graphs represent the average run time of models where consumer
preference for mom-and-pops is 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8
respectively. Note that the big box store appears in period 20. 

[Graph 1.0]		[Graph 1.2]
[Graph 1.4]		[Graph 1.6]
[Graph 1.8]

Clearly the trend is for environments whose consumers have a "low
enough" preference to lose their mom and pop stores. In [Graphs 1.0,
1.2, 1.4. and 1.6], the consumer utility was raised by the presence of
the big box store; yet in the end, its presence drove out the mom and
pops, leaving it in the cases where consumers prefered mom and pops to
big boxes where the end result was a net loss in utilty.
